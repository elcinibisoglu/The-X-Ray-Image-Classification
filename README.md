# The-X-Ray-Image-Classification
In this study, a dataset that covers X-ray chest images from patients is used to classify chest images as Normal, Pnemonia and Covid-19. By the aim of classification, two approaches are used as ResNet18 and a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model which is created by us for this project.
